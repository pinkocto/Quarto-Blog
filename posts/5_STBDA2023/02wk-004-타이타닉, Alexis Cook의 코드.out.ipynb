    "Logging into Kaggle for the first time can be daunting. Our competitions\n",
    "often have large cash prizes, public leaderboards, and involve complex\n",
    "data. Nevertheless, we really think all data scientists can rapidly\n",
    "learn from machine learning competitions and meaningfully contribute to\n",
    "our community. To give you a clear understanding of how our platform\n",
    "works and a mental model of the type of learning you could do on Kaggle,\n",
    "we’ve created a Getting Started tutorial for the Titanic competition. It\n",
    "walks you through the initial steps required to get your first decent\n",
    "submission on the leaderboard. By the end of the tutorial, you’ll also\n",
    "have a solid understanding of how to use Kaggle’s online coding\n",
    "environment, where you’ll have trained your own machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if this is your first time entering a Kaggle competition, regardless\n",
    "of whether you: - have experience with handling large datasets, -\n",
    "haven’t done much coding, - are newer to data science, or - are\n",
    "relatively experienced (but are just unfamiliar with Kaggle’s platform),\n",
    "\n",
    "you’re in the right place!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Get started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll learn more about the competition and make your\n",
    "first submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Join the competition!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is to join the competition! Open a new window with\n",
    "**[the competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)**, and click\n",
    "on the **“Join Competition”** button, if you haven’t already. (*If you\n",
    "see a “Submit Predictions” button instead of a “Join Competition”\n",
    "button, you have already joined the competition, and don’t need to do so\n",
    "again.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/07cskyU.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes you to the rules acceptance page. You must accept the\n",
    "competition rules in order to participate. These rules govern how many\n",
    "submissions you can make per day, the maximum team size, and other\n",
    "competition-specific details. Then, click on **“I Understand and\n",
    "Accept”** to indicate that you will abide by the competition rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition is simple: we want you to use the Titanic passenger data\n",
    "(name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and\n",
    "who will die.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a look at the competition data, click on the\n",
    "**<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Data\n",
    "tab</b></a>** at the top of the competition page. Then, scroll down to\n",
    "find the list of files.  \n",
    "There are three files in the data: (1) **train.csv**, (2) **test.csv**,\n",
    "and (3) **gender_submission.csv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) train.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "**train.csv** contains the details of a subset of the passengers on\n",
    "board (891 passengers, to be exact – where each passenger gets a\n",
    "different row in the table). To investigate this data, click on the name\n",
    "of the file on the left of the screen. Once you’ve done this, you can\n",
    "view all of the data in the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/cYsdt0n.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the second column (**“Survived”**) can be used to\n",
    "determine whether each passenger survived or not: - if it’s a “1”, the\n",
    "passenger survived. - if it’s a “0”, the passenger died.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the first passenger listed in **train.csv** is Mr. Owen\n",
    "Harris Braund. He was 22 years old when he died on the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the patterns you find in **train.csv**, you have to predict\n",
    "whether the other 418 passengers on board (in **test.csv**) survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on **test.csv** (on the left of the screen) to examine its\n",
    "contents. Note that **test.csv** does not have a **“Survived”** column -\n",
    "this information is hidden from you, and how well you do at predicting\n",
    "these hidden values will determine how highly you score in the\n",
    "competition!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) gender_submission.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The **gender_submission.csv** file is provided as an example that shows\n",
    "how you should structure your predictions. It predicts that all female\n",
    "passengers survived, and all male passengers died. Your hypotheses\n",
    "regarding survival will probably be different, which will lead to a\n",
    "different submission file. But, just like this file, your submission\n",
    "should have: - a **“PassengerId”** column containing the IDs of each\n",
    "passenger from **test.csv**. - a **“Survived”** column (that you will\n",
    "create!) with a “1” for the rows where you think the passenger survived,\n",
    "and a “0” where you predict that the passenger died.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Your coding environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll train your own machine learning model to improve\n",
    "your predictions. *If you’ve never written code before or don’t have any\n",
    "experience with machine learning, don’t worry! We don’t assume any prior\n",
    "experience in this tutorial.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is to create a Kaggle Notebook where you’ll store\n",
    "all of your code. You can use Kaggle Notebooks to getting up and running\n",
    "with writing code quickly, and without having to install anything on\n",
    "your computer. (*If you are interested in deep learning, we also offer\n",
    "free GPU access!*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by clicking on the\n",
    "**<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/kernels\" target=\"_blank\">Code\n",
